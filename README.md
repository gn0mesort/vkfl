# vulkan-function-loader

This repository is a Vulkan command function pointer loader.

I made this because I didn't feel like any of the available solutions suited me particularly. Maybe you'll like it too.

## Using

You can use vulkan-function-loader in two ways. First, you can use it as a meson subproject. To do this include this repository as a subproject and use the `vkfl_dep` variable as a dependency. Meson should handle the rest.

```meson
vkfl_proj = subproject('vulkan-function-loader')
vkfl_dep = vkfl_proj.get_variable('vkfl_dep')
```

Second, you can use the files generated by vulkan-function-loader directly. To do this just generate the files as follows:

```sh
meson build
ninja -C build
```

Once this is done, you can copy the resulting `function_loader.hpp` and `function_loader.cpp` files wherever you like.
